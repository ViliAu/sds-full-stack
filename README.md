# Install instructions
All modules need to have their dependencies installed before they can be ran.
    This is done by going into each module's/project's root folder with a terminal and typing in "npm i"

# Run instructions
The modules are started by typing "npm start" in the terminal while in the root folder
    An exception to this is the Angular module (module 4) where "ng serve --open" should be typed instead
